# 2. Use tools for specific enhancements
/test-harness Add integration tests for WebSocket connections
/security-scan Check for WebSocket vulnerabilities
/docker-optimize Optimize container for WebSocket connections

# 3. Use a workflow for comprehensive review
/full-review Review the entire chat feature implementation
```

### Example: Modernizing Legacy Code

```bash
# 1. Start with the modernization workflow
/legacy-modernize Migrate Express.js v4 app to modern architecture

# 2. Use specific tools for cleanup

/refactor-clean Remove deprecated patterns and dead code
/test-harness Ensure 100% test coverage

# 3. Optimize and deploy
/docker-optimize Create multi-stage production build

```

## Command Orchestration Patterns

Commands can be used individually or combined in powerful patterns:

### Sequential Execution
```bash
# Build → Test → Secure → Deploy pipeline
/api-scaffold user management API
/test-harness comprehensive test suite for user API  
/security-scan check user API for vulnerabilities
/k8s-manifest deploy user API to production
```

### Parallel Analysis
```bash
# Multiple perspectives on the same codebase
/multi-agent-review comprehensive architecture and code review
/security-scan audit security posture  
/performance-optimization identify and fix bottlenecks
# Then consolidate findings
```

### Iterative Refinement
```bash
# Start broad, then narrow focus
/feature-development implement payment processing
/security-scan focus on payment security
/compliance-check ensure PCI compliance
/test-harness add payment-specific tests
```

### Cross-Domain Integration
```bash
# Frontend + Backend + Infrastructure
/api-scaffold backend payment API
/multi-agent-optimize optimize payment flow performance
/docker-optimize containerize payment service
/monitor-setup payment metrics and alerts
```

## When to Use Workflows vs Tools

### 🔀 Workflows & Subagent Tools
- **Problem-solving**: Analyze and fix issues adaptively
- **Multiple perspectives**: Coordinate specialist subagents
- **Complex tasks**: Multi-step processes across domains
- **Unknown solutions**: Let subagents determine approach

### 🛠️ Specialized Tools
- **Infrastructure setup**: Configure environments
- **Code generation**: Create specific implementations
- **Analysis**: Generate reports without fixes
- **Domain tasks**: Highly specialized operations

**Examples:**
- "Implement user authentication system" → `/feature-development`
- "Fix performance issues across the stack" → `/smart-fix`
- "Modernize legacy monolith" → `/legacy-modernize`

### 🔧 Use Tools When:
- **Specific expertise needed** - Clear, focused task in one domain
- **Precise control desired** - Want to direct specific implementation details
- **Part of manual workflow** - Integrating into existing processes
- **Deep specialization required** - Need expert-level implementation
- **Building on existing work** - Enhancing or refining previous outputs

**Examples:**
- "Create Kubernetes manifests" → `/k8s-manifest`
- "Scan for security vulnerabilities" → `/security-scan`
- "Generate API documentation" → `/doc-generate`

## Command Format

Slash commands are simple markdown files where:
- The filename becomes the command name (e.g., `api-scaffold.md` → `/api-scaffold`)
- The file content is the prompt/instructions executed when invoked
- Use `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for user input

## Best Practices

### Command Selection
- **Let Claude Code suggest automatically** - Analyzes context and selects optimal commands
- **Use workflows for complex tasks** - Subagents coordinate multi-domain implementations
- **Use tools for focused tasks** - Apply specific commands for targeted improvements

### Effective Usage
- **Provide comprehensive context** - Include tech stack, constraints, and requirements
- **Chain commands strategically** - Workflows → Tools → Refinements
- **Build on previous outputs** - Commands are designed to work together

## Contributing

1. Create `.md` file in `workflows/` or `tools/`
2. Use lowercase-hyphen-names
3. Include `$ARGUMENTS` for user input

## Troubleshooting

**Command not found**: Check files are in `~/.claude/commands/`

**Workflows slow**: Normal - they coordinate multiple subagents

**Generic output**: Add more specific context about your tech stack

**Integration issues**: Verify file paths and command sequence

## Performance Tips

**Command Selection:**
- **Workflows**: Multi-subagent coordination for complex features
- **Tools**: Single-purpose operations for specific tasks
- **Simple edits**: Stay with main agent

**Optimization:**
- Start with tools for known problems
- Provide detailed requirements upfront
- Build on previous command outputs
- Let workflows complete before modifications

### Adding a New Workflow:
- Focus on subagent orchestration and delegation logic
- Specify which specialized subagents to use and in what order
- Define coordination patterns between subagents

### Adding a New Tool:
- Include complete, production-ready implementations
- Structure content with clear sections and actionable outputs
- Include examples, best practices, and integration points
